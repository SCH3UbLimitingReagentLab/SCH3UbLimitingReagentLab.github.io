                                <h3>1.	Discuss your observations. Compare changes between trials.</h3>

                                <p>	As the baking soda was dropped into the vinegar during the first trial, colourless bubbles began to evolve. The balloon that was wrapped around the neck of the bottle began to inflate.The balloon did not inflate evenly; some parts of the balloon seemed to be more inflated than others, so the balloon was not a perfect spherical shape but rather an irregular somewhat round shape. Eventually, within about a minute, most of the bubbles had disappeared and a transparent liquid remained. The same things occurred during the second trial (in which less baking soda was used), except there was a lesser quantity of bubbles and the balloon inflated far less, so less CO2 was released in the reaction. 
                                </p>

                                <h3>
                                    2.	While you could not fully calculate the percent yield of this reaction, how did the varying amounts affect the amount of CO2 produced? You should use your observations and if possible the diameter of the balloon at its largest. You can use a string to measure a diameter and then measure the length of that same string.

                                </h3>
                                <p>	The varying amounts of the baking soda added is directly correlated with the amount of CO2 to be increased (increase in baking soda = increase in CO2, vice versa), this is evident because the balloon was significantly bigger in our first trial (1 tablespoon) than our second trial (1/2 tablespoon). This is rational because for both times, the baking soda was the limiting reagent in the reaction. To be specific, our first trial had a diameter of 35 centimeters, whereas our second trial had a 26 centimetres. We can roughly estimate the amount of CO2 produced (actual yield) by finding the volume of the two balloons using the volume formula for a sphere (this will not be exactly accurate, it should only be an estimate). Our first trial’s volume is around 720 centimeter cubed, and our second trial’s volume is around 3.0 *10^2 centimeter cubed. This is correct because the first volume is roughly around two times that of our second trial’s. 
                                </p>
                                <p>We have already calculated the theoretical yield of this reaction, which is around 0.0628 moles (or 2.76 grams) of CO2 for our first trial, and around 0.0332 moles (or 1.46 grams) of CO2.
                                </p>
                                <p>	We can attempt to have a rough estimate of our percent yield by attempting to convert our CO2 molecules from moles to litres, then comparing our theoretical yield with our actual yield. We can do this by first finding the molar volume, which, according to a collective publication by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas, at room temperature and pressure; it is equal to the molar mass divided by the mass density (IUPAC, 1993). We know the molar mass of CO2 (44.01g/mol), so we must find the mass density of CO2. According to the Engineering Toolbox, the mass density of CO2 is about 1.98 kg/m^3 (Gases - Densities, 2016). Therefore, after some calculations, the molar volume of CO2 is about 0.0222 m^3. Therefore, now we can find a rough, rough estimate of our actual yield. 0.222 m^3 is about 22200 mL, after multiplying by our moles for each of the two trials, we obtain the theoretical yields (in mL) of around 1390 mL for our first trial, and 747 mL for our second trial.
                                </p>
                                <p>	Now, we can compare our rough estimate of actual yield with our rough estimate of theoretical yield to obtain a rough estimate of our percent yield. For trial 1, (720mL/1390mL) * 100% gives us around 5.0 * 10^1% for our theoretical yield. For trial 2, (3.0*10^2 mL/747 mL) *100% gives us around 4.0 *10^1% for our theoretical yield. Again, this is just a rough estimate.
                                </p>

                                    3.	Given that you have completed this experiment outside the lab and therefore have not used proper laboratory equipment, discuss the errors that have been introduced in this lab. Discuss how they impacted the desired outcome of understanding the concept of the limiting reagent and how you could reduce these errors.
                                </h3>
                                <p>Because this experiment was completed outside a lab, there are some possible errors within the way we conducted the experiment which could have yielded a result slightly different than if all variables were accounted for. It is particularly important to identify errors with our method because errors can aid in learning. Janet Metcalfe, a Ph.D. of psychology at Columbia University, remarks in a paper she wrote that, “error generation appears to foster learning” (Metcalfe, 2017). The first thing we could not account for was the impact the type of balloon we used could have on the result of the experiment. Though we used two identical balloons to conduct each trial of the experiment, the size and composition of our balloons could have influenced the degree to which they were inflated. The other thing we could not account for was the shape of the water bottle. We used two identical bottles for both trials, but the shape of the bottle still could have impacted the way CO2 was released up into the balloon, which would have impacted our observations during the experiment. These errors could have impacted our observations during the experiment.

                                    4.	Discuss your learning outcomes from this lab. Namely how this lab has helped your understanding of limiting reagents, particularly during this time where the access to the lab is restricted.
                                </h3>
                                

                                <p>	This lab has definitely helped with our understanding of limiting reagents. Seeing a reaction like this actually happen as opposed to just seeing it as an equation really added to our understanding of what was happening. Something that really helped us understand limiting reagents was when we decided to perform the experiment a second time just out of curiosity. After we had done the required two trials in which we had changed the quantity of baking soda used, we decided to see what would happen if we changed the amount of vinegar. When we changed the amount of vinegar, the balloon had the exact same circumference as the balloon in our first trial. At first, we just assumed we did something wrong, and we did not think much of it since we were not performing this third trial for our experiment - we wanted the baking soda to be the variable we changed for our experiment and thus we were just doing this extra trial out of curiosity. However, we were later thinking about this when we were doing our calculations. We realized that since baking soda was the limiting reagent, the amount of CO2 released would remain constant as long as the amount of baking soda remained constant, no matter how much vinegar was used in the experiment. Thus, we realized that if we had decided to change the amount of vinegar instead of baking soda between trials for our actual experiment, the result of the reaction would be identical. Obviously, we already learned this principle in class, but to put it all together and be able to really understand why the reactions in this experiment occurred the way they did was a real learning moment.
